[00:20.68] What's wrong with the world, mama?
[00:22.15] People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
[00:24.33] I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
[00:27.08] Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
[00:51.58] 
[00:29.78] Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
[00:31.96] But we still got terrorists here livin'
[00:34.76] In the USA, the big CIA
[00:37.56] The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK
[00:55.56] 
[00:40.66] But if you only have love for your own race
[00:42.57] Then you only leave space to discriminate
[00:45.22] And to discriminate only generates hate
[00:47.79] And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
[01:15.29] 
[00:51.13] Madness is what you demonstrate
[00:53.05] And that's exactly how anger works and operates
[00:55.44] Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
[00:57.98] Take control of your mind and meditate
[01:00.03] Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all
[01:24.53] 
[01:02.82] People killin', people dyin'
[01:04.34] Children hurt, hear them cryin'
[01:07.11] Can you practice what you preach
[01:09.59] Or would you turn the other cheek?
[01:26.59] 
[01:11.78] Father, Father, Father, help us
[01:14.53] Send some guidance from above
[01:17.04] 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
[01:20.42] Where is the love (love)
[01:32.42] 
[01:23.22] Where is the love? (The love)
[01:25.80] Where is the love? (The love)
[01:28.12] Where is the love, the love, the love?
[01:47.12] 
[01:32.53] It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
[01:34.18] New days are strange, is the world insane?
[01:36.15] If love and peace are so strong
[01:38.33] Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
[02:01.83] 
[01:40.23] Nations droppin' bombs
[01:41.89] Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
[01:43.89] With ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
[01:46.41] So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
[02:07.91] 
[01:48.63] So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
[01:51.67] In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
[01:54.36] Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
[01:56.69] Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
[01:59.12] A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover
[02:21.62] 
[02:01.48] The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
[02:04.38] If you never know truth then you never know love
[02:07.07] Where's the love, y'all, come on? (I don't know)
[02:08.94] Where's the truth, y'all, come on? (I don't know)
[02:11.84] Where's the love, y'all?
[02:23.84] 
[02:13.15] People killin', people dyin'
[02:15.07] Children hurt, hear them cryin'
[02:17.66] Can you practice what you preach
[02:20.99] Or would you turn the other cheek?
[02:37.99] 
[02:23.28] Father, Father, Father, help us
[02:26.23] Send some guidance from above
[02:28.96] 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
[02:32.11] Where is the love (love)
[02:44.11] 
[02:33.77] Where is the love? (The love)
[02:34.18] Where is the love? (The love)
[02:34.41] Where is the love? (The love)
[02:34.77] Where is the love? (The love)
[02:35.30] Where is the love? (The love)
[02:36.16] Where is the love? (The love)
[02:38.64] Where is the love, the love, the love?
[02:57.64] 
[02:43.96] I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
[02:45.97] As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
[02:48.47] Most of us only care about money makin'
[02:51.04] Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
[03:15.04] 
[02:53.57] Wrong information always shown by the media
[02:56.07] Negative images is the main criteria
[02:58.69] Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
[03:01.23] Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema, yo'
[03:27.23] 
[03:04.13] Whatever happened to the values of humanity?
[03:06.78] Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
[03:09.06] Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
[03:11.83] Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity
[03:36.33] 
[03:14.47] That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
[03:17.12] That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
[03:19.66] There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
[03:22.20] Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
[03:24.88] Now ask yourself
[03:32.88] 
[03:26.13] Where is the love?
[03:27.77] Where is the love?
[03:30.06] Where is the love?
[03:32.12] Where is the love?
[03:41.12] 
[03:34.50] Father, Father, Father, help us
[03:37.63] Send some guidance from above
[03:39.93] 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
[03:43.17] Where is the love?
[03:52.17] 
[03:45.82] Sing with me y'all (one world, one world)
[03:48.83] We only got (one world, one world)
[03:51.44] That's all we got (one world, one world)
[03:53.74] And something's wrong with it (yeah)
[03:55.69] Something's wrong with it (yeah)
[03:57.09] Something's wrong with the wo-wo-world, yeah
[03:59.29] We only got (one world, one world)
[04:01.97] That's all we got (one world, one world)
