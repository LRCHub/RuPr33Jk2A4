Where is the love (where is the lo-ove)
Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the lo-ove (where is the lo-ove)
Where is the love (where is the love)

Where is the love you said you'd give to me
Soon as you were free, will it ever be, Where is the love...

You told me that you didn't lo-ove her
And you were gonna say goodbye-ye-ye
But if you really didn't mea-ean it
Why did you have to lie..., Where is the love

Where is the love (where is the lo-ove)
Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the lo-ove (where is the lo-ove)
Where is the love (where is the love)

Where is the love you said was mine all mine
Till the end of time, was it just a lie, Where is the love...

If you had had a sudden change of heart
I wish that you would tell me so-o-o
Don't leave me hangin' on to pro-omises
You've got to let me know...
Where is the love

Oh how I wish I'd never me-et you
I guess it must have been my fa-a-ate
To fall in love with someone else's love
All I can do is wait...

Oh where is the love, where is the love
Where is the love, where is the love
Where is the love (fade)
