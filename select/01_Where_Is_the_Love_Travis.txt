Outside in
Songs we've shared
We don't care
Where is the love
Now we regret nothing yet
Don't forget
We must get some love

Now I'm not saying love is gone
But I'm afraid that everytime I read the paper
Watch the TV
There's not a lot of love anymore
Or could it be that simple
Or could it be that bold

Now I'm not saying love is blind
But I'm afraid that everytime I read the paper
Or watch the TV
There's not a lot of love anymore
Or could it be that simple
Or could it be that bold

Outside in
Songs we've shared
We don't care
Where oh where is the love
