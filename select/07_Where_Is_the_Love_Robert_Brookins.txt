Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
Where is the love?

Where is the love you said you'd give to me
Soon as you were free?
Will it ever be? (Eh, eh, eh, yeah, eh, eh, eh.)
Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
You told me that you didn't need him
And you were gonna say goodbye.
But if you really didn't mean it,
Why did you have to lie?

Where is the love you said was mine all mine
Till the end of time?
Was it just a lie? (No, no, no.)
Where is the love? (Where is the love?)
If you have had a sudden change of heart,
(Had a sudden change)
I wish that you would tell me so.
Oooh, oooh, oooh.
Don't leave me hanging on promises.
You got to let me know.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Where is the lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ove?

Oh, how I wish I never met you.
Oh, honey, I guess (I guess) it must've been my fate
To fall in love with someone else's love.
All you can do is wait. (That's all I can do.)
All I can do, ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aby.
(That's all I can do. Ohhh. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.)
